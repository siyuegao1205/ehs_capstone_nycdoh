## Health-based Concentrations for Air

Note that RfCs are for non-cancer effects. The health-based guidance for TCE (trichloroethene) and PCE (tetrachloroethene) are based on **cancer effects**. There is not really a health-based value for BTEX, because some of the components (e.g., benzene) are much more toxic than others. BTEX concentrations mainly indicate the amount of petroleum-related contamination.The vapor barrier will attenuate the concentration by roughly 10%, so the aim is to have an indoor air concentration less than the guidance value or RfC.

Compound  | Concentration ($\mu$g/`r expression("m"^3)`) | 
------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Benzene  | 30 | Reference Concentration (RfC) (from US EPA)
Toluene  | 5000 | RfC (from US EPA)
Ethylbenzene  | 1000 | RfC (from US EPA)
Xylenes  | 100 | RfC (from US EPA)
TCE  | 2 | NYS DOH and NYC guidance value
PCE  | 30 | NYS DOH and NYC guidance value
