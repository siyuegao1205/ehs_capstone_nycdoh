```{r}
phoenix = extract_tables(
    file   = "data/2019-01-17.19TMP0033K.RIR Phase II Report.Revised 19TMP0033K.RIR Phase II Report - EBC V2.pdf.1.pdf", 
    method = "decide", 
    output = "data.frame")

p = phoenix[[210]]
```

Tried to read the whole pdf in - the results seemed to be too chaotic for any further extracting and cleaning.


```{r}
soil_vapor = extract_tables(
    file   = "data/Soil_Vapor_Table.pdf", 
    method = "decide", 
    output = "data.frame")

title = soil_vapor[[1]]
continue = soil_vapor[[2]]
```

If we manually split the pdf before reading in, the results seemed to be more promising.
